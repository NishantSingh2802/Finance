# Project Details
In 2018, the firm launched a new investment product, “Term Deposit”, which has observed a rapid growth since its inception. The increase in term deposit accounts has provided the firm with additional funds to create other offerings. Hence, based on this performance, it further wants to increase its term deposit accounts amongst existing customers. In order to do so, the firm plans to run a campaign and wants to identify a list of customers who could be contacted via telecommunication channels to open a term deposit account with ABC.
